# Adventure Jam 2023

A repo for our game jam as a part of the Adventure Jam for 2023 on itch.io

Our plan is to develop a 2D platforming horror game focused on exploration and puzzle solving. Explore a dark and dangerous temple of ancient orogin, and uncover the monsters that lurk within. Once we have a name for this idea we will slap that shit on here LMAOOOOOO
